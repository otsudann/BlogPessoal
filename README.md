# Where's your code?

To ease my code management, and centralize everything, I had to create two branches. So, to access it, choose from the githubs menu or click the links below:

- [backend](https://github.com/otsudann/BlogPessoal/tree/backend)
- [frontend](https://github.com/otsudann/BlogPessoal/tree/frontend)

## About this project ðŸš€

This is my personal blog, created along with [Generation Brasil](https://brazil.generation.org/) Bootcamp, using Java + Spring + Reactjs.

It's still under development, and I have a lot of things to do with it, but you can access [here](https://otsudann-frontend.herokuapp.com/) to check it out.

Thanks!
